Hey! I'm a student at the University of Central Florida studying computer science. Although I have experience working on many aspects of game development, my focus and passion is graphics programming and engine programming. My hobby project, [the Ard Engine](https://github.com/ReeCocho/ard-engine) is a good demonstration of those skills.

I'm current open to hire, so if you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
