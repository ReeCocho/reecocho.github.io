Hey! I'm a graduate of the University of Central Florida with a B.A. in computer science. I've been a programmer since I was 10, and have been interested in game development for just as long. Although I have experience working on many aspects of game development, my focus and passion is graphics programming and engine programming. Beyond game development I have experience in web development, embedded, systems programming, and robotics. I'm constantly looking for new challenges and new opportunities to learn. My hobby project, [the Ard Engine](https://github.com/ReeCocho/ard-engine), is an excellent demonstration of that tenacity.

Outside of programming, I'm into music, guitar, writing, tabletop games, and fantasy novels (ask me about the First Law).

I'm currently open to hire, so if you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
